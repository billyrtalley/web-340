Title: Exercise 1.3

Description: Modules and the three components (third-party, built-in, and custom)
Notes: A module is a bit of code encapsulated in a file and exported to another file (Crutchfield. 2018).
CommonJS allows for code encapsulation, as modules with no global variables wonâ€™t
conflict with each other when your application is run (Crutchfield. 2018). 
 Without module systems like CommonJS, dependencies had to be loaded in <script> tags in the
header of an HTML file, OR all code had to be lumped together which is incredibly slow
and inefficient for file loading (Crutchfield. 2018).
