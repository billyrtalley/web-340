Title: Exercise 1.3

Description: Modules and the three components (third-party, built-in, and custom)
Notes: A module is a bit of code encapsulated in a file and exported to another file (Crutchfield. 2018).
CommonJS allows for code encapsulation, as modules with no global variables wonâ€™t
conflict with each other when your application is run (Crutchfield. 2018). 
 Without module systems like CommonJS, dependencies had to be loaded in <script> tags in the
header of an HTML file, OR all code had to be lumped together which is incredibly slow
and inefficient for file loading (Crutchfield. 2018).

var url = require('url'); //requires the url module and puts it in the variable url
//(Hahn. 2016)

var parsedURL = url.parse('https://www.example.com/profile?name=talley');
//takes the url string, parses it and returns a URL object (VS Code. 2021)

console.log(parsedURL.protocol); 
//parses the protocol  https: (Hahn. 2016)
console.log(parsedURL.host);
//parses the host www.example.com. (Hahn. 2016)
console.log(parsedURL.query);
//parses the query profile?name=talley
